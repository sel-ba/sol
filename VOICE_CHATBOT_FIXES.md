# Voice Chatbot - Investigation & Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Character Limit
**Problem:** The TTS feature had a 800-character limit that was cutting off longer AI responses.

**Location:** `frontend/src/components/FloatingChat.tsx` - Line 173

**Root Cause:** The code checked `if (cleanText && cleanText.length < 800)` before speaking, preventing longer responses from being read aloud.

**Fix Applied:** Removed the character limit check, allowing responses of any length to be spoken.

```typescript
// BEFORE
if (cleanText && cleanText.length < 800) { // Increased length limit
  speak(cleanText);
} else {
  console.log('Text too long or empty, not speaking');
}

// AFTER
if (cleanText) { // Removed character limit - speak any length response
  speak(cleanText);
} else {
  console.log('Text is empty, not speaking');
}
```

### 2. Auto-Send on Voice Transcription
**Problem:** Messages weren't being sent automatically after transcription; users had to manually click send.

**How It Works:** 
- The auto-send functionality was already implemented but requires the user to **click the "Stop" button** to trigger it
- When speech recognition ends, the `onend` event fires and triggers the auto-send callback
- The transcribed text is automatically sent to the AI and the response is spoken back

**Location:** `frontend/src/hooks/useSpeechRecognition.ts` - Lines 65-77

**Improvements Made:**
1. Reduced auto-send delay from 500ms to 300ms for faster response
2. Added better logging to track when auto-send is triggered
3. Updated UI to clearly indicate users need to click "Stop" to send

## How Voice Mode Works Now

### User Flow:
1. **Click "Voice" button** â†’ Starts listening
2. **Speak your question** â†’ Live transcription shown
3. **Click "Stop" button** â†’ Automatically sends the transcription
4. **AI responds** â†’ Response is automatically spoken aloud
5. **Conversation continues** â†’ Can immediately start speaking again

### Key Features:
- âœ… Real-time voice visualization with volume-reactive pulsing
- âœ… Live transcript display while speaking
- âœ… Automatic message sending when "Stop" is clicked
- âœ… Text-to-speech for AI responses (no character limit)
- âœ… Clean markdown removal for better speech quality
- âœ… Voice mode stays active for continuous conversation

## UI Improvements

### 1. Dynamic Help Text
The help text at the bottom now changes based on state:
- **Normal:** "Press Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line"
- **Listening:** "ðŸŽ¤ Listening... Click 'Stop' to send your message automatically"

### 2. Listening Screen Enhancements
- Shows live transcript in a styled box
- Clear instruction: "Click 'Stop' button to send your message"
- Microphone emoji for better visual feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Speech Recognition Hook (`useSpeechRecognition.ts`)
```typescript
recognitionRef.current.onend = () => {
  setIsListening(false);
  stopVolumeMonitoring();
  
  // Auto-send the transcript if callback is set and there's text
  const currentTranscript = transcriptRef.current.trim();
  if (autoSendCallbackRef.current && currentTranscript) {
    console.log('Speech recognition ended, auto-sending:', currentTranscript);
    setTimeout(() => {
      autoSendCallbackRef.current?.(currentTranscript);
      setTranscript('');
      transcriptRef.current = '';
    }, 300); // Reduced delay for faster response
  }
};
```

### Text-to-Speech Cleanup
The TTS system cleans AI responses by:
- Removing markdown formatting (`**bold**`, `*italic*`)
- Converting bullet points to periods
- Removing newlines
- Removing "Sources:" sections
- Removing numbered lists

This ensures natural speech output.

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/FloatingChat.tsx`
   - Removed 800-character TTS limit
   - Updated help text to be context-aware
   - Enhanced listening visualization with live transcript
   - Added clear instructions for auto-send

2. `frontend/src/hooks/useSpeechRecognition.ts`
   - Reduced auto-send delay (500ms â†’ 300ms)
   - Added better logging for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with short responses (< 100 chars)
2. Test with medium responses (100-500 chars)
3. Test with long responses (> 1000 chars) - should now work!
4. Test voice mode conversation flow:
   - Start voice â†’ speak â†’ stop â†’ listen to response â†’ repeat
5. Verify transcript appears while speaking
6. Verify auto-send triggers when "Stop" is clicked

## Known Behavior

- **Voice mode requires manual stop:** Users must click "Stop" to send the message. This is intentional to allow users to:
  - Pause while thinking
  - Correct or continue their statement
  - Control when the message is sent

- **Continuous mode:** Speech recognition is set to `continuous: true`, meaning it will keep listening until manually stopped, allowing for longer statements.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Silence Detection:** Auto-send after X seconds of silence
2. **Wake Word:** Implement "Hey Compass" wake word detection
3. **Voice Commands:** "Send", "Cancel", "Clear" voice commands
4. **Language Selection:** Support for multiple languages
5. **Voice Speed Control:** Allow users to adjust TTS speed/pitch
6. **Voice Selection:** Let users choose different TTS voices
